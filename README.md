#DiveFlorida

Simple tool utilizing an weather API and leaflet.js to draw a map with dive sites as markers.

I intend to work on this project over time and add new features.
 - Better weather information (tides, wind direction, and more indepth temp descriptions)
 - Include a randomizer that will select a random dive spot in Florida, sort of redudant but thought it would be cool to help with picking your next dive spot if you're willing to drive :).
 - Include a pictures for each site on the marker tab so that you can cycle through what that site has to offer.
 - Possibly look to add community contributions which would require some sort of user Auth, permissions, and approval method. This really would make this a time consuming project but would be great for learning.
 - Additionally, as I get better at recognizing bad code. I intend to rewrite segments of this project to clean it up as I know in its current form it is janky.
